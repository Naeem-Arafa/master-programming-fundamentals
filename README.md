## Introduction

This repository contains carefully curated content from various sources and personal experience. It focuses on the most important basics that every programmer should know. While this is certainly not all of the content that I studied, but this is the most important and what I see as very important.I will mention the content in order and note the things that I have not studied yet, but I consider them important, and I will study them later ,I upload it for reason that if person finished the previous one has the ability to study them so that he desn't crash, the repo will constantly updated to add more.

## Repository Structure

- **Programming Advices**: Contains important fundamental programming details using C++ and C#, and it is one of the most important sources I learned from. It also contains a complete roadmap.
- **Elzero Web School**: It features a strong basic roadmap, but it is not complete. It will be updated later when Elzero adds new content.
- **Extension and Important Sources**: Includes additional resources on Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database...etc.
- **Websites for Learning**: Lists essential websites for further learning.
- **Important Tools**: Highlights tools useful for programming and problem solving.
- **Websites for Problem Solving**: Provides websites to practice coding problems.
- **Extensions**: Additional topics like STL (Standard Template Library)...etc.
- **Books**: Recommended reading for deeper understanding.
- **Important Tips**: General tips for effective learning and problem-solving.

## Programming Advices

Explore the `programming-advices` folder to find essential programming fundamentals using C++ and C#. This section emphasizes foundational concepts, logical thinking, and cumulative learning. Additionally, it addresses Windows Forms development using .NET.
The content focuses on developing thought processes and logical skills, highlighting the importance of linking separate components to create a comprehensive application. This approach aligns with the "divide and conquer" theory, making complex projects more manageable and understandable.

## Elzero Web School

The `elzero-web-school` folder contains content from Elzero Web School, known for its strong foundational roadmap.It contains strong content and lots of problem solving and libraries, and you can continue to solve problems on site. Note that this is a work in progress and will be updated as new content is released.
